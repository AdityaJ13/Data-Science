## Data-Science
This Repository contains all the projects I did in my PGP in Data Science and Business Analytics. 
Apart from the code, it also contains detailed yet to the point analytics reports for each project.
The repository is further divided into several subfolders or subtopics which consists of the relevant
code, solution and a project report which derives valuable insights and discusses several repurcussions
of the solution path chosen.

The following subfolders/subtopics are included in the repository.

### Statistical Methods for decision Making
The project involved drawing inferences from 3 case studies, namely - Wholesale Customer Data (Store Sales), University Survey Data & Manufacturing Shingles Data. The concepts of various measures of Descriptive Statistics, Probability and Probability Distributions and various measures of Estimation & Hypothesis Testing are used to analyse these case studies

## Mcdonald's Data Visualization Competition
Every year, for beginners in the field of data science, great learning organizes a visualization competition and when I was pursuing the course it was called as McDonald's competition, as it was based on McDonald's data. Three out of several hundreds of participants are chose to be winners, and I was one of the three winners.

### Advanced Statistics
The project involved drawing inferences from 2 case studies, namely - Hay Fever Drug Analysis, College Admissions Data. The concepts of Exploratory Data Analysis, Analysis of Variance, and Principal Component Analysis are used to draw inferences from these case studies.

### Data Mining
The project involved drawing inferences from 2 case studies, namely - Bank Marketing & Insurance. The concepts of Clustering, CART, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network are used to draw inferences from these case studies. Various performance metrics have been used to validate the performance of predictions on Test & Train sets

### Predictive Modelling
This project is based on 2 cases studies : Gems Price Prediction and Holiday Package prediction. In the first case study, concepts of linear regression are tested and it is expected from the learner to predict the price of gems based on multiple variables to help company maximize profits. In the second case, concepts of logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis are tested. One has to predict if the customer will purchase the holiday package to target the relevant customer base.

### Machine Learning and Ensemble techniques
This project is based on 2 case-studies: Vote Prediction and Text Analysis. The first project is to predict which party a citizen is going to vote for on the basis of their age and according to the answers given by the citizens to the questions asked in a survey conducted. The second project is based on the analysis of the inaugural U.S.A. Presidential speeches. One has to draw inferences based on the analysis done on these speeches

### Time Series Forecasting
Analyzed historical monthly sales data of a company. Created multiple forecast models for two different products of a particular Wine Estate and recommended the optimum forecasting model to predict monthly sales for the next 12 months along with appropriate lower and upper confidence limits

### Market and Retail Analytics
This project aims to find the underlying buying patterns of the customers of an automobile part manufacturer based on the past 3 years of the Company's transaction data and hence recommend customized marketing strategies for different segments of customers. Tools used were RFM, KNIME and clustering.

### Capstone Project
The capstone project involved the amalgation and use of all the tools and techniques learnt so far. I did the project on Customer churn analysis which would help company figure out causes of churn and the road ahead to prevent churn an maximize customer retention.

A DTH company was facing huge customer Churn(18%). The company wanted to reduce this proportion and retain the customers. For this the major task was to build a ML model that can predict churn and analyze the root cause of it. Further, certain suggestions and recommendations were given as a part of company's marketing campaign
